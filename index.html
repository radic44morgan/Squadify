<h1>Spotify Collab </h1>

<p><strong>Description</strong> - This website will be used to allow users to create a singular queue for Youtube that they can all add to at the same time.  For example, if a group of people were in a room listening to music, they could connect to the website, add songs to the queue, and then listen to them through someones laptop connected to a speaker.  Where as now, one person is in charge of the queue and everyone has to tell them what to queue up.</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong> - This project will utilize the Youtube API for the playback and song searching.  There is no persistance needed, so a database will not be used. 
Essentially, a user will create a queue, which will come with a passcode.  This queue will be created within the controller, that will also hold all the song information.  Other users can connect to that queue with the passcode, and then add songs to the queue.  When a user adds a song to the queue, it will be added to the queue model.  The device that created the queue will play the current song.  This website would be useful for parties, pregames, roadtrips, etc.  Really, any event where a group of people are listening to music.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule</strong> - for the first checkpoint, a user will be able to create a queue and other users can log into said queue.  For the second checkpoint, users will be able to add songs simultaneously to a queue.  For the third checkpoint, the master user will be able to log into Youtube and play the songs added.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong> - This project has a great use case that many college kids will use.  College aged kids love to listen to music together, and they do so a lot, so this application will get a lot of us.  It is complex in how it integrates multiple systems (Youtube API, Google APIs) and how it relies on the use of multiple users.</p>
